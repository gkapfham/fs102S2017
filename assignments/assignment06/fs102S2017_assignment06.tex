\section*{Giving Your Second Presentation}

Now that you have begun to investigate the topic of digital piracy and to collect evidence-based findings and opinions
about this topic, you are ready to present your own views on this issue. Along with having a captivating title and an
attention-getting device, it should also contain concrete data points, screenshots, and concrete examples. After picking
a partner with whom you will have an ``editor-presenter'' relationship, you should create a new GitHub repository for
your presentation using a similar naming convention to the one introduced in the previous practical assignment.

In summary, the source code for your presentation will be hosted in a new GitHub repository and displayed by the RawGit
content delivery network (CDN). After finishing this assignment you should be able to view both a local version of your
slides running on your development computer and a publicly visible version of the slides that are available in both
GitHub and RawGit. Your presentation should, whenever possible, feature all of the elements mentioned in the previous
paragraph. Additionally, your slides should contain enough content to ensure that they support you giving a talk that
lasts for between five and seven minutes.

Your focus should be on the preparation of simple slides that help you to make your main point. If your schedule
permits, you are welcome to enhance the slide template that you created in the previous practical assignment by, for
instance, changing the background and/or highlight colors and picking new fonts. Once you have finished preparing your
slides, you should ensure that your editor gives you feedback on the content of each slide and the flow between the
slides. After ensuring that you have resolved all of the concerns raised by your editor, you should also practice giving
the presentation to your editor and your colleagues not in this class. You should deliver your practice talks in our
classroom, further ensuring that you can quickly located and display your slides.

you can and should incorporate feedback from your editor, any deliverables that are nearly identical to the work of
