\MYTITLE{Final Project Assignment\\Assigned: Monday, April 24, 2017\\Due: May 9, 2017 no later than 5:00 pm}

\vspace*{-.2in}
\section*{Introduction}

Leveraging the feedback that you received for each of the prior deliverables for this course, you will prepare a final
project portfolio, available as a mobile-ready web site hosted by GitHub, that showcases the revised version of each
writing and presentation assignment. In addition, you will work with an editor to prepare a final article, of at least
1000 words, that draws on all of your past articles and presentations while still persuasively articulating your view of
a course-related issue. That is, your article should identify some challenge concerning how people in society use modern
technology and then persuasively articulate a solution to this issue. To persuasively argue your point this article
should leverage all of the writing techniques in the following course textbooks. In particular, your article should
persuasively explain, by using at least one of the ``templates'' in the {\em They Say, I Say} book, why you have
proposed an appropriate solution to your chosen problem.

Finally, you should write and publish two candid 100 to 200 word statements about the benefits and drawbacks associated
with using software technology to support effective communication. Specifically, you should write a short statement
evaluating the use of GitHub and Markdown to publish articles on a mobile-ready web site. The second article must
consider the advantages and disadvantages of using GitHub and Reveal.js to prepare and deliver mobile-ready
presentations.
