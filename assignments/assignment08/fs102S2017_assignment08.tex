\MYTITLE{Final Project Assignment\\Assigned: Monday, April 24, 2017\\Due: May 9, 2017 no later than 5:00 pm}

\vspace*{-.2in}
\section*{Introduction}

Leveraging the feedback that they received for each of their writing and presentation assignments, you will prepare a
final project portfolio, available as a mobile-ready web site hosted by GitHub, that showcases the revised version of
each writing and presentation assignment. In addition, you will prepare a final article, of at least 1000 words, that
draws on all of your past articles and presentations while still persuasively articulating your view of a course-related
issue. Moreover, it should identify some challenge concerning how people in society use modern technology and then
persuasively articulate a solution to this issue. Your article should leverage all of the writing techniques in the
following course textbooks to persuasively argue your point. In particular, your article should employ at least one of
the ``templates'' in the {\em They Say, I Say} book to persuasively explain why you have proposed an appropriate
solution to your chosen problem.

% The Academic Honor Program that governs the entire academic program at Allegheny College is described in the Allegheny
% Course Catalogue. The Honor Program applies to all work that is submitted for academic credit or to meet non-credit
% requirements for graduation at Allegheny College. This includes all work assigned for this class (e.g., examinations,
% writing assignments, and presentations). All students who have enrolled in the College will work under the Honor
% Program. Each student who has matriculated at the College has acknowledged the following pledge:

% \vspace*{-.1in}
% \begin{quote}
%   I hereby recognize and pledge to fulfill my responsibilities, as defined in the Honor Code, and to maintain the
%   integrity of both myself and the College community as a whole.
% \end{quote}
% \vspace*{-.1in}

In adherence to the Honor Code, students should complete the main writing of this assignment on an individual basis.
While you can and should incorporate feedback from your editor, any deliverables that are nearly identical to the work
of others will be taken as evidence of violating Allegheny College's \mbox{Honor Code}. Please see the course instructor
with questions about this policy.
