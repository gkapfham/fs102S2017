\MYTITLE{Assignment 2\\Assigned: Wednesday, February 8, 2017\\Due: Wednesday, February 15, 2017 at the start of class}

\vspace*{-.2in}
\section*{Introduction}

Now that you have created the first version of your mobile-ready web site and the site is ``live'', you are ready to
begin adding content to your site. In this assignment, you will write the first article that will be featured on your
web site. Consisting of between 600 and 1000 words, your article should contain four or five paragraphs of writing.
Additionally, your article will have both a header image that is released through Flickr under a Creative Commons
License and a license statement for the image. Along with having a captivating title, a TL;DR, and links to other
articles and web sites, your first featured article will be promoted through a social media campaign. In order to
successfully complete this assignment, please carefully adhere to the following guidelines.

\vspace*{-.1in}
\begin{itemize}
  \setlength{\itemsep}{-.01in}

\item {\bf If possible, use the laboratory computers.} If it is absolutely necessary for you to work on a different
  machine, be sure to regularly transfer your programs to the Alden machines and check their correctness. Please
  remember that, as stated in the syllabus, students should try to complete assignments using the specialized
  workstations in the laboratory. If you cannot use a laboratory computer, then please carefully explain the setup of
  your laptop to a teaching assistant or the course instructor when you are asking questions.

\item {\bf Follow each step carefully.} Slowly read each sentence in every assignment sheet, making sure that you
  precisely follow each instruction. Take notes about each step that you attempt, recording your questions and ideas
  and the challenges that you faced. If you are stuck, then please tell a teaching assistant or instructor what step
  you recently completed.

\item {\bf Regularly ask and answer questions.} Please log into Slack at the start of a class or practical session and
  then join the appropriate channel. If you have a question about one of the steps in an assignment, then you can post
  it to the designated channel. Or, you can ask a student sitting next to you or talk with a teaching assistant or the
  course instructor.

\item {\bf Store your files in Git}. Starting with this laboratory assignment, you will be responsible for storing all
  of your files in a Git repository. Please verify that you have saved your source code in your Git repository by
  typing ``{\tt git status}'' and ensuring everything is up to date.

\item {\bf Keep all of your files!} Don't delete your programs, output files, and reports after you hand them in---you
  will need them again later when you study for the quizzes and examinations and work on the other laboratory,
  practical, and final project assignments.

\item {\bf Back up your files regularly}. Use a flash drive, Google Drive, or your favorite backup method to keep a
  copy of your files in reserve. In the event of a system failure, you are responsible for ensuring that you have
  access to a recent backup copy of all your files.

\end{itemize}

\section*{Disciplined Writing with Version Control}

  \item If you do not already have a GitHub account, then please go to the GitHub web site and create one---make
    sure that you use your {\tt allegheny.edu} email address so that you can join the GitHub Educational Community as
    this step becomes necessary. Also, please make sure that you add a description of yourself and an appropriate
    professional photograph to your GitHub profile. For examples of what a professional GitHub profile might look like,
    please consider studying {\tt https://github.com/una} and {\tt https://github.com/gkapfham}.



  \item You should complete this assignment in collaboration with two editors. You will be responsible for asking these
    two editors to read your writing and give you feedback through the GitHub issue tracker. An editor will provide
    feedback through the issue tracker by clicking the ``Commits'' tab in GitHub's main interface, finding the commit
    number that contains the issue that you have identified in the writing, copying this number to the clipboard, and
    then using it when you report the issue. A writer will then consider the feedback, respond to it, and, when
    appropriate, resolve the issue that the editor raised. Each writer should also review the writing of the other two
    team members. While it is acceptable to read and mark printed versions of the article, all discussion should be
    visible in the GitHub issue tracker.

  \item Even though we will work on this assignment during at least two class sessions, you should budget enough time to
    outline, draft, discuss, and frequently revise this writing assignment. Remember, your focus should be on publishing
    an article that is concise, accessible, and error-free. Also, the main text of this writing assignment should be
    accompanied by a ``TL;DR'' or a ``Too Long; Didn't Read'' that summarizes the key points about yourself. Please see
    the instructor if you confront difficulties when using GitHub or if you have additional questions.

\end{enumerate}

  \item A 600 to 1000 word article that explains some of the benefits of using the Internet.
  \item A header image from Flickr that is released under a Creative Commons licensing agreement.
  \item Evidence in the GitHub issue tracker for the discussion and revision of your article.

\end{enumerate}

In adherence to the Honor Code, students should complete this assignment on an individual basis. While it is appropriate
for students in this class to have high-level conversations about the assignment, it is necessary to distinguish
carefully between the student who discusses the principles underlying a problem with others and the student who produces
assignments that are identical to, or merely variations on, someone else's work. Any deliverables that are nearly
identical to the work of others will be taken as evidence of violating Allegheny College's \mbox{Honor Code}.
