\MYTITLE{Assignment 2\\Assigned: Wednesday, February 8, 2017\\Due: Wednesday, February 15, 2017 at the start of class}

\vspace*{-.2in}
\section*{Introduction}

Now that you have created the first version of your mobile-ready web site and the site is ``live'', you are ready to
begin adding content to your site. In this assignment, you will write the first article that will be featured on your
web site. Consisting of between 600 and 1000 words, your article should contain four or five paragraphs of writing.
Additionally, your article will have both a header image that is released through Flickr under a Creative Commons
License and a license statement for the image. Along with having a captivating title, a TL;DR, and links to other
articles and web sites, your first featured article will be promoted through a social media campaign. In order to
successfully complete this assignment, please carefully adhere to the following guidelines.

\vspace*{-.1in}
\begin{itemize}
  \setlength{\itemsep}{-.01in}

\item {\bf If possible, use the laboratory computers.} If it is absolutely necessary for you to work on a different
  machine, be sure to regularly transfer your programs to the Alden machines and check their correctness. Please
  remember that, as stated in the syllabus, students should try to complete assignments using the specialized
  workstations in the laboratory. If you cannot use a laboratory computer, then please carefully explain the setup of
  your laptop to a teaching assistant or the course instructor when you are asking questions.

\item {\bf Follow each step carefully.} Slowly read each sentence in every assignment sheet, making sure that you
  precisely follow each instruction. Take notes about each step that you attempt, recording your questions and ideas
  and the challenges that you faced. If you are stuck, then please tell a teaching assistant or instructor what step
  you recently completed.

\item {\bf Regularly ask and answer questions.} Please log into Slack at the start of a class or practical session and
  then join the appropriate channel. If you have a question about one of the steps in an assignment, then you can post
  it to the designated channel. Or, you can ask a student sitting next to you or talk with a teaching assistant or the
  course instructor.

\item {\bf Store your files in Git}. Starting with this laboratory assignment, you will be responsible for storing all
  of your files in a Git repository. Please verify that you have saved your source code in your Git repository by
  typing ``{\tt git status}'' and ensuring everything is up to date.

\item {\bf Keep all of your files!} Don't delete your programs, output files, and reports after you hand them in---you
  will need them again later when you study for the quizzes and examinations and work on the other laboratory,
  practical, and final project assignments.

\item {\bf Back up your files regularly}. Use a flash drive, Google Drive, or your favorite backup method to keep a
  copy of your files in reserve. In the event of a system failure, you are responsible for ensuring that you have
  access to a recent backup copy of all your files.

\end{itemize}

\section*{Writing a Feature Article}

This assignment invites you to write an article that explains, using concrete and compelling examples, how the use of
the Internet and the Web has improved your life. You are encouraged to use the ideas that you developed during our last
two in-class brainstorming sessions as the starting point for this assignment. Working with a partner with whom you will
have an ``editor-writing'' relationship, please publish a high-quality and error-free article by following these steps.

\begin{enumerate}

  \itemsep 0em

  \item First, you should pick a partner for this assignment. You will serve as the ``editor'' for your partner's
    writing and your partner will be the ``editor'' for your writing. To start, please make sure that you and your
    partner know each other's GitHub site and web site. An editor will provide feedback through the issue tracker by
    clicking the ``Commits'' tab in GitHub's main interface, finding the commit number that contains the issue that you
    have identified in the writing, copying this number to the clipboard, and then using it when you report the issue. A
    writer will then consider the feedback, respond to it, and, when appropriate, resolve the issue that the editor
    raised. While it is acceptable to read and mark printed versions of the article, all discussion should be publicly
    visible in the GitHub issue tracker.

  \item Even though we will work on this assignment during at least two class sessions, you should budget enough time to
    outline, draft, discuss, and frequently revise this writing assignment. Remember, your focus should be on publishing
    an article that is concise, accessible, and error-free. Also, the main text of this writing assignment should be
    accompanied by a ``TL;DR'' or a ``Too Long; Didn't Read'' that summarizes the key points about yourself. Please see
    the instructor if you confront difficulties when using GitHub or if you have additional questions.

  \item Using your terminal window, please go to the directory that contains the files for your web site. Now, find and
    change into the {\tt \_posts} directory where you will find the sample posts that come with the template that we are
    using for your web site. Keeping one of these files to use as an example, please delete all of the other post files
    as they will no longer be needed. Now, use graphical file browser (or, the ``{\tt mv}'' command if you have
    experience with it), rename the reserved file to one that would be appropriate for your new article. Please consider
    naming your file according to the title that you developed during the two prior brainstorming sessions.

  \item At this point, you should use the Atom text editor to change the contents of the file that you renamed in the
    previous step. The first thing that you should do is revise the ``header'' of this file that is at the very top of
    the editor's window. For instance, you should create a new title and subtitle for your article. Next, delete the
    rest of the content from the prior article.

  \item Your article must feature a header image that you download from Flickr. Please make sure that your image is
    licensed under a creative commons license and is suitable for use in an academic setting. To start your search for a
    header image, please go to the following web site: {\tt https://www.flickr.com/creativecommons/}. Once you have
    found the image that you want to include on your site, you can use the ``Flickr attribution helper'' that is
    available at {\tt https://cogdog.github.io/flickr-cc-helper/} to get the correct reference for your image. Next,
    download your image and save it in the {\tt img/} directory of your web site. Ultimately, the image should appear at
    the top of your article. You should also make sure that the full license statement and the credit for the image is
    at the bottom of the article. Please see the instructor or a teaching assistant if you have questions about the
    completion of this step.

\end{enumerate}

\section*{Summary of the Required Deliverables}

This writing assignment invites you to complete the following tasks. After completing the assignment, please make sure
that you submit a printed version of your article to the course instructor.

\vspace*{-.1in}
\begin{enumerate}
  \setlength{\itemsep}{0in}

  \item A 600 to 1000 word article that explains some of the benefits of using the Internet.
  \item A header image from Flickr that is released under a Creative Commons licensing agreement.
  \item Evidence in the GitHub issue tracker for the discussion and revision of your article.
  \item Documentation of a social media campaign that convinces your friends to read your article.
  \item Reviews, through multiple GitHub issues and a full-featured discussion, of your peers' writing.

\end{enumerate}
\vspace*{-.1in}

In adherence to the Honor Code, students should complete this assignment on an individual basis. While it is appropriate
for students in this class to have high-level conversations about the assignment, it is necessary to distinguish
carefully between the student who discusses the principles underlying a problem with others and the student who produces
assignments that are identical to, or merely variations on, someone else's work. Any deliverables that are nearly
identical to the work of others will be taken as evidence of violating Allegheny College's \mbox{Honor Code}.
